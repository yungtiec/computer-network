# The Story of IP 
## Analogy
If we think of the domain name (github.com) as personal name, IP address is like a street address. The fields in an IP address kind of resembles to country, state, city, street, and street number. When one sends a mail, he/she puts the message in an envelope, writes down the address, and then puts the envelope in the nearest mailbox, leaving the task of delivery to the mailman. Supposed the mail is destined to another city, the mailman does not go search for the exact house, he/she simply takes the mail to the local post office, which sends the mail to the right city, where someone knows the street and street number and finishes the delivery.
Since Internet reaches virtually everywhere in the world, users cannot possibly know all the IP address. Fortunately, the Internet keeps a address book in DNS so one can find the someone else's address using domain name. 
## Overview
The IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, is responsible for addressing hosts and routing datagrams from source to desination host across one or more IP networks. 
IP is a connectionless protocol, is hence an unreliable protocol with no gurantee of reliable delivery, error-free delivery, or ordered delivery. Reliability issues are resolved at upper layer (TCP). 
Currently, both IPv4 and IPv6 are deployed. 
## IPv4
IP version 4 uses 32-bit(4 byte) addresses, limiting the address space to 2<sup>32</sup>. (actually less than this number because some spaces are reserved for special uses, like 224 is reserved for multicast addressing) 
## IPv6
## IP mobility
## VPN
